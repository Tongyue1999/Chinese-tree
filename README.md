This repository contains code and resources for the analysis of heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes (T2D) using both R and Python. The project includes subtype visualization via DDRTree and feature extraction using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

## Contents

- **Chinese DDRTREE.ipynb**:  
  An R notebook used for visualizing Chinese T2D subtypes with the DDRTree algorithm.  
  *Note: This file requires additional R scripts or functions not included here. Please contact the author to obtain the full functionality.*

- **VAE_code.ipynb**:  
  A Python notebook for training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and extracting features from multi-omics data. This script is compatible with standard machine learning libraries including PyTorch.
